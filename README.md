# SEC Financial Chatbot 

A conversational AI chatbot designed to extract, analyze, and summarize financial data from SEC 10-K filings. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data parsing techniques to make SEC reports more accessible and user-friendly.

##  Features

-  **Financial Data Extraction**: Parses key financial metrics (Revenue, Net Income, etc.) from 10-K reports.
-  **Chatbot Interface**: Answers natural language questions about company performance using extracted data.
   **LLM Integration**: Utilizes large language models to interpret and summarize financial text.
-  **Structured Output**: Saves results to Excel for further analysis or reporting.

##  How It Works

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Parses raw SEC 10-K filings (via EDGAR or local input).
   - Identifies key sections using regular expressions and section headers.
   - Stores data in structured format.

2. **Chatbot Module**:
   - Loads extracted financial data.
   - Accepts user queries (e.g., "What was the net income in 2022?").
   - Returns contextually relevant answers using NLP logic.

3. **LLM Enhancement** *(optional)*:
   - Can be extended with OpenAI/GPT APIs for deeper insights.

##  Sample Questions

- “How did the company’s revenue change in 2022?”
- “What are the main expenses reported?”
- “Summarize the risk factors section.”

##  Future Improvements

- Integrate real-time EDGAR scraping
- UI/UX for non-technical users
- Time-series visualizations
- Multilingual chatbot capability
